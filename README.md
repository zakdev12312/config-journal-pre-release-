## 📓 What is Config Journal?

*Config Journal* is a plain-text archive of my personal digital setup—focused on simplicity, privacy, and efficiency. No configs to clone, no scripts to run—just clean markdown notes documenting the apps I use, the tweaks I make, and how I stay focused in a bloated digital world. My interpretation of (almost) everything tech—quietly opinionated, always in progress.

Minimal stack, maximum clarity.

> “Your setup is your studio—make it intentional.”
