# 🛡️ Privacy Stack

For browser-isolated, containerized workspaces, I rely on [Kasm Workspaces CE](https://www.kasmweb.com/). It’s one of the best free tools out there for privacy-conscious computing—open source, self-hostable, and surprisingly smooth once set up.

**Setup Notes:**
- It took about an hour to configure, but it was well worth it.
- Kasm uses Docker containers to stream entire OS environments directly to your browser.
- Modest system requirements, but for VM deployment I recommend at least **16 GB RAM** on your host machine.

> Clean isolation without the heavyweight overhead of full VMs.

Other tools I use for privacy:
- `Tor Browser` for anonymity
- `Surfshark VPN` for no-logs tunneling
- `uBlock Origin + CanvasBlocker` for browser fingerprint defense
Tor is easily the most secure browser for browsing anywhere, based on Firefox.
