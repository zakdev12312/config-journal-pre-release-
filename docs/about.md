# 👤 About Me

Hey, I'm Zak — a config minimalist, vault architect, and full-time wrangler of systems that don’t like being told what to do.
## 🌐 Other Stuff

A cozy corner of the internet where I hoard social profiles, reviews, and digital chaos — all wrapped in minimalist vibes and squirrel mischief.

This repo? It’s part documentation, part digital reflection, and part rebellion against bloated workflows. What started as a cleanup project has become a constantly evolving archive of the tools I trust, the rules I live by (digitally, anyway), and the odd config philosophy no one asked for but I wrote down anyway.

## 🎛️ What I’m Into  
- Building workflows that actually *work*  
- Tools that do their job without needing a TED Talk  
- Markdown everything  
- Gaming as both escape and critical analysis  
- Designing interfaces that respect your time (and eyeballs)

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists  
So I can think clearly.  
So others can borrow ideas without borrowing bloat.  
So every decision has a home, even the ones I reverse later.

## 🗂️ Other Places to Explore  
 - [My Notion Workspace](config-journal-docs.notion.site)-full of wild subpages and structured chaos
