# 🌐 My Browser Choice

I currently use [![Opera Browser](https://img.shields.io/badge/Opera-Browser-red)](https://opera.com)—fast, private, and feature-rich out of the box. That said, feel free to use whatever browser aligns with your setup.
The goal is performance without clutter.

> Bonus: I disable unnecessary integrations and use built-in ad blocking to stay focused.
Alternative picks: Firefox (hardened), Brave (privacy-focused), or even ungoogled Chromium.
