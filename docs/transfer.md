# ðŸ“¤ File Transfer Tools

For local network transfers, I use  
[![LocalSend](https://img.shields.io/badge/Local-send-darkgreen)](https://localsend.org) â€” a simple, fast, and private way to send files between devices on the same network.

For remote transfers over longer distances,  
[![Blip App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Blip-App-purple)](https://blip.net) is my go-toâ€”end-to-end encrypted and easy to use across platforms.

> Minimal setup, maximum reach.
