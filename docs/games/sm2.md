## 🧬 A Series Evolved

From the moment I booted up *Spider-Man 2*, it was clear: this isn’t just a follow-up — it’s a full-blown evolution. The city’s bigger, the stakes are higher, and the dual-Spidey dynamic between Peter and Miles is seamless.

This game doesn’t just build on what came before — it *honors* it.

## 🕹️ Two Heroes, One Web

- **Switching between Peter and Miles** mid-story and open world is buttery smooth  
- Each has their own powers, side quests, and emotional arcs  
- Peter’s **symbiote suit** brings raw aggression  
- Miles’ **Venom powers** feel electric and expressive  

It’s not just about who you play — it’s about *why* you’re playing them.

## 🌆 New York, Reimagined

- Expanded map now includes **Brooklyn, Queens, and Coney Island**  
- **Web Wings** add verticality and speed to traversal  
- The city feels more alive than ever — from street-level chatter to rooftop solitude  

This isn’t just a playground. It’s a living, breathing world that reacts to you.

## 🧠 Zak’s Reflection

This series started my gaming journey. *Spider-Man (2018)* was the first game that made me feel like I belonged in this world. *Miles Morales* showed me how the story could grow. And now, *Spider-Man 2* proves how far it’s all come — and how far I’ve come with it.

> I’m not just playing a game anymore. I’m continuing a legacy I started, 5 years ago.

**Rating:** 🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️ / 5 — *A web well woven*
