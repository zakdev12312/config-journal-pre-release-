# 🐿️ Squirrel with a Gun
## (2024, Dee Dee Creations / Maximum Entertainment)

> “A squirrel. A firearm. A neighborhood full of chaos. That’s the pitch — and it delivers.”

### 🎮 Game Summary  
This is a physics-driven sandbox where you play as a squirrel armed with human-sized weaponry. You’ll steal guns from agents, launch yourself across rooftops using recoil, and cause general suburban mayhem. It’s absurd, self-aware, and built for short bursts of hilarity.

### 🧠 Personal Take  
I’ve only scratched the surface, but it’s already clear this game leans fully into its ridiculous premise. It feels like a natural evolution of *Goat Simulator* — but with more bite. The jank is part of the charm, and the moment-to-moment chaos is genuinely entertaining.

It’s not trying to be deep or polished. It’s just here to let you be a tiny menace with a big attitude — and that’s exactly what I wanted from it.

### 💥 Highlights

- **Recoil Mobility:** Firing a shotgun to launch yourself across a backyard never stops being funny.
- **Finisher Animations:** Each weapon has its own over-the-top takedown — squirrel kung fu meets action movie parody.
- **Exploration:** Hidden acorns, secret labs, and rooftop puzzles give the chaos some structure.

---

### 🐾 Rough Edges

- **Combat Simplicity:** Enemies barely react. Once you’ve seen a few takedowns, the novelty dips.
- **Short Runtime:** You can finish the main content in a few hours — it’s more a snack than a full meal.
- **Performance Bugs:** Occasional crashes and floaty controls can break the flow.

### 🎧 Audio / Visual Notes

- Visuals are basic but serviceable — more prototype charm than polish.  
- Sound design is minimal, but the gunfire and ragdoll physics carry the comedy.

### 🧃 Final Thought  
*Squirrel with a Gun* is a one-trick game — but it commits to the bit with full confidence. If you’re in the mood for something chaotic, silly, and unapologetically weird, this one’s worth a spin.
