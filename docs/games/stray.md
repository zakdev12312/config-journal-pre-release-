> “You’re not saving the world. You’re just trying to find your way home — and somehow, that’s enough.”

### 🎮 Game Summary  
*Stray* is a third-person adventure where you play as a lost cat navigating a decaying cybercity. With the help of a small drone companion, you explore neon-lit alleys, solve environmental puzzles, and uncover the remnants of a forgotten world — all from a feline perspective.

### 🧠 Personal Take  
I’ve only played a little so far, but even in that short time, *Stray* left a serious impression. The **visuals are stunning**, the **atmosphere is thick with mood**, and the **storytelling is subtle but powerful**. It’s one of those games that doesn’t need to explain itself — it just lets you feel your way through.

There’s something quietly profound about seeing a broken world through the eyes of a creature that doesn’t speak. It’s not trying to be epic — it’s just **intimate, strange, and beautiful**.

### 🌆 What Stands Out

- **Environmental Design:** Every alley, rooftop, and corridor feels handcrafted. The city tells its own story through clutter, signage, and decay.
- **Cat Mechanics:** You can meow, scratch, nap, knock things off shelves — and it never feels gimmicky. It’s just... right.
- **Tone & Pacing:** Little combat. Just exploration, light puzzles, and moments of stillness. It’s meditative without being slow.

### 🎧 Audio & Mood

- The soundtrack is sparse and synthy — equal parts cozy and eerie.  
- Ambient sounds (fans, neon buzz, distant footsteps) do a lot of heavy lifting.  
- Curling up to sleep and letting the camera pan out? Pure serenity.

### 🚧 Spoiler-Free Notes

- There’s a companion character that adds emotional depth without overexplaining.  
- The world is inhabited, but not by humans — and that absence is felt in every corner.  
- The game respects your curiosity. It never rushes you.

### 🧭 Final Thought  
*Stray* doesn’t shout. It hums. It purrs. It lets you wander through a forgotten place and find meaning in the small things — a nap spot, a memory, a meow in the dark. I’m excited to return and see where the path leads.
