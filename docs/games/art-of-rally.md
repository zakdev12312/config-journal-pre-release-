## 🏞️ First Impressions

From the moment the menu fades in, *art of rally* sets a tone that’s both chill and quietly exhilarating. Its low-poly landscapes bathed in shifting sunlight feel almost meditative — a postcard from an alternate retro motorsport timeline. You don’t just drive here. You float, slide, and dance across scenery.

## 🎨 Visual Vibe

The aesthetic is pure intentionality:  
- **Muted colors** with bold contrasts  
- **Top-down perspective** that feels like rally meets miniature diorama  
- **Smooth lighting** and **stylized dust trails** that make every drift a visual treat  

The graphics don’t just suit the game — they *complete* it. It wouldn't be the same in gritty realism.

## 🕹️ Handling & Fun Factor

There’s a beautiful tension between:
- forgiving arcade fun  
- and enough challenge to keep you focused  

The physics lean toward the “loose but learnable” end of the spectrum. Once it clicks, chaining corners becomes incredibly satisfying — like finding a rhythm in the snow.

## 🎧 Audio Atmosphere

- An *80s-inspired synthwave* soundtrack that’s equal parts mellow and pulsing  
- Engine notes and gravel skids feel intentionally muted — letting the music breathe  
- Immersive, but never overbearing

## 🔥 Verdict

**art of rally** is more than a driving game. It's a playable concept album — style-forward, nostalgic, and endlessly charming. For fans of drifting as a state of mind, this is a must-drive.
