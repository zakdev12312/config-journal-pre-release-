# 🏎️ Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown 
## — First Drive Report

> "This isn't just racing. It's lifestyle simulation wearing driving gloves."

### 🎮 Game Summary  
TDU: Solar Crown attempts to revive the open-world luxury racer genre. Set on a 1:1 recreation of Hong Kong Island, you're dropped into a lavish lifestyle where exploration, ownership, and competition blend. Drive, flex, explore.

### 🧠 Personal Take  
I genuinely think this game is — and continues to be — **overhated**. Yes, it launched with flaws. Yes, it’s not as polished as some hoped. But it’s also a **long-awaited sequel** to a beloved series that dared to do something different. It captures the spirit of *Test Drive Unlimited 2* in a way that feels intentional, not nostalgic. And that deserves more credit than it gets.

### 🔍 What Hit

- **Driving Feel:** Somewhere between Forza Horizon and GT — not sim-level, but every car feels distinct.
- **World Design:** Hong Kong Island is genuinely atmospheric — winding mountains, urban tunnels, and off-road routes.
- **Immersion Touches:** You can walk into dealerships, browse cars IRL-style, and hang out in your hotel room.

### ⚠️ What Dragged

- **Always Online:** No solo mode. Even single-player content requires connectivity.
- **Bugs & Instability:** AI can be erratic, UI occasionally breaks, and loading hangs still happen.
- **Progression Pace:** Feels quite grindy unless you're hyper-optimized. Style over speed in early game.

### 🎧 Audio / Visual Notes

- Engine audio is sharp. Wind noise, shifting weight — immersive.  
- Visuals are mixed — striking in some areas, rough in others (lighting and shadows especially).
- I have found that in places with high desity traffic, even the PlayStation 5 does lag; optimization needed.

### 🧠 Final Thought  
This game knows what it wants to be — it just isn’t *always* that. But when it clicks? It’s *cruising in heavy weather with mood lighting on and synthwave playing*. And somehow, that’s exactly what I wanted.
