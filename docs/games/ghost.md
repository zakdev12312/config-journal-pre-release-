## (2020, Sucker Punch Productions / Sony Interactive Entertainment)

> “Some games are cinematic. This one is poetry with a blade.”

### 🎮 Game Summary  
Set during the Mongol invasion of Tsushima in 1274, you play as Jin Sakai — a samurai torn between honor and survival. It’s an open-world action epic that blends stealth, swordplay, and storytelling with a reverence for Japanese history and aesthetics.

### 🧠 Personal Take  
I haven’t played much yet — but even from the opening hours, *Ghost of Tsushima* hit me hard. The **visuals are breathtaking**, the **combat feels weighty**, and the **story... I genuinely don’t have words**. It’s rare for a game to feel this intentional. Every frame looks like it was painted with purpose.

This is one of those titles where you can tell — even early on — that it’s something special. And honestly? I think it’s **outstanding**, even from the little I’ve seen.

### 🎨 What Stands Out

- **Visual Direction:** The lighting, weather, and color grading are unreal. It’s like playing inside a Kurosawa film.
- **Combat Flow:** Swordplay is tight and satisfying. Parrying feels earned. Duels are cinematic without being overdone.
- **Atmosphere:** The wind guiding you, the fox shrines, the flute — it’s immersive without UI clutter.

### 🧪 To Explore More

- I want to see how the stealth evolves — early mechanics are solid but simple.
- Curious how the story deepens — the emotional weight is already there.
- Iki Island and Legends mode are still untouched — saving those for later.

### 🔮 Looking Ahead: Ghost of Yōtei  
With *Ghost of Yōtei* on the horizon, I’m genuinely excited to see where Sucker Punch takes this universe next. A new protagonist, a new setting in Hokkaido, and a fresh narrative thread — it feels like the perfect evolution. If it carries even a fraction of the soul Tsushima had, it’s going to be something unforgettable.

### 🧘 Final Thought  
Even with limited playtime, *Ghost of Tsushima* feels like a **masterclass in tone and restraint**. It doesn’t shout — it whispers with confidence. And that’s rare.
