## 🧵 Where It All Began

For me, *this* wasn’t just another superhero game. This was the *first* one — not just the first time I played as Spider-Man, but honestly, the first time I *felt* like I was part of something bigger than just the screen.

It was the start of my gaming journey.

There’s a kind of magic that happens when you swing between Manhattan skyscrapers and realize: *this feels right*. *This feels like mine*.

## 🗽 The City That Breathes

Insomniac didn’t just recreate New York — they gave it a pulse:
- Citizens react to your movement  
- The sunsets feel nostalgic, even on a first playthrough  
- Rooftop to street-level transitions are seamless and alive  

Every corner became a place worth visiting. Even if I had nowhere to go in-game, I’d still swing just for the joy of it.

## 🤺 Combat & Fluidity

- Fast-paced and responsive  
- Customizable gadgets and skills  
- That *perfect* blend of improvisation and rhythm  

You’re not just fighting. You’re performing.

## 🧑‍🔬 Peter Parker, Unmasked

The game strikes a rare balance:  
- **Being Spider-Man** is exhilarating  
- **Being Peter Parker** is *relatable*  

You feel his weight — the rent, the guilt, the science projects that never quite pay off (pun intended). And somehow, it makes the mask mean more.

## 🧠 My Reflection

Before this, games were just *things other people played*. *Spider-Man* changed that. It handed me the controller and said, “You belong here too.”

I didn’t just play it — I discovered something about myself in the process.
