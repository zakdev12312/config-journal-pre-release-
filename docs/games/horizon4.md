## â€“ Quiet Roads, Still Golden

I came back to *Forza Horizon 4* recently, and it still feels like a quiet kind of magic.  
The roads through the UK countrysideâ€”especially at golden hourâ€”hit differently.  
Thereâ€™s something calming about drifting through autumn leaves or cruising past stone walls in a Porsche 911 GT3 Touring,  
knowing the game isnâ€™t asking anything of me except to enjoy the drive.

The seasonal system still impresses me. Itâ€™s not just a visual gimmickâ€”it changes how the world feels.  
Winter makes the roads slick and reflective, spring brings out the mud and bloom, and summer is justâ€¦ open.  
I love how the game doesnâ€™t rush me. I can spend an hour tuning a car, taking photos, or just driving with no destination.

Itâ€™s not perfect. The menus are a bit bloated, and the online elements sometimes feel like noise.  
But when Iâ€™m alone on a quiet road, with the radio off and the sun setting behind the hills,  
it becomes more than a game. It becomes a space.
