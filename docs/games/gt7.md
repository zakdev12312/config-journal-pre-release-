## 🚘 Built for the Passionate

*Gran Turismo 7* isn’t just a racing game — it’s a museum, a classroom, and a garage full of dreams. It’s for the kind of person who polishes virtual fenders and downshifts out of habit, not need.

As a car lover, this is where the hobby meets the road.

## 🔧 Tuning Your Soul

This is where it sings:
- A **robust tuning system** that rewards tinkering  
- Suspension, diff, gearing — every part matters  
- Your car becomes a reflection of *you*, not just your skill  

Whether you're chasing lap times or sculpting drivability, GT7 makes mechanical intuition feel like an art form.

## 🌍 From Sunday Drives to Suzuka

- **License tests** that still teach discipline  
- **Track variety** from tight touge to global circuits  
- **Dynamic weather** that makes each lap feel different  

Driving in GT7 feels like reconnecting with roads you’ve never been on — but somehow know by heart.

## 📸 Car Culture, Captured

Scapes mode isn't just a gimmick. It's love:
- Over 2,500 real-world photogenic backdrops  
- Full control over lighting, aperture, and placement  
- Car guy heaven, if heaven had lens flare

And the in-game *Café*? Surprisingly heartfelt. It celebrates history, not just horsepower.

## 🎧 The Audio Journey

They finally nailed it:
- Engines breathe and growl — not looped samples  
- Exhaust notes are tuned to body and class  
- Interior resonance and tire squeal actually teach you something  

Put on a good pair of headphones and you’ll drive just to *listen*.

## 💬 My Thoughts

As someone who gets joy from heel-toe downshifts and watching replays at 0.25x just to admire body roll — this is the first racer since GT4 that truly *feels* like it was made for people like me.

> It doesn’t just simulate cars — it respects them.
