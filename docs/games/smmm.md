## 🕸️ The Bridge Between Heroes

I played this before *Spider-Man 2*, and even before I knew how far the series would go — this was my first time stepping into someone else’s Spidey suit. And while it felt shorter than both Peter’s debut and the sequel that followed, it still left a lasting mark.

This wasn’t just a side story. It was a *passing of the torch*.

## ❄️ Harlem in Winter

- A snow-covered New York that feels more intimate  
- Holiday lights, street art, and community warmth  
- Miles’ connection to Harlem makes the city feel personal, not just playable  

It’s not just about saving the city — it’s about *belonging* to it.

## ⚡ Venom Powers & Style

- Combat is flashier, more expressive  
- Venom abilities add flair without overcomplicating  
- Miles moves differently — less polished, more *alive*  

Even swinging feels like jazz compared to Peter’s classical rhythm.

## 🧠 My Take

Yes, it’s shorter. But that doesn’t mean it’s lesser.  
*Miles Morales* is a focused, heartfelt chapter that gave me a new perspective on what it means to be Spider-Man — and it made me even more excited for what came next.

> A compact story with a big heart.  
**Rating:** 🎧🎧🎧🎧🕸️ / 5 beats dropped mid-swing
