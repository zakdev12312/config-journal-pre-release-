## 🚐 A Road Trip With No Map

You don’t play one hero in *Road 96* — you play many. Anonymous teens fleeing a fictional authoritarian country, each with their own reasons for crossing the border. Every route, ride, and decision is procedurally stitched together, making each journey feel fresh yet oddly familiar.

No two runs are the same — and that’s exactly why it’s *unskippable*.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Characters Worth Following

- **Zoe**, the rebel with doubts  
- **Stan & Mitch**, lovable criminal chaos  
- **Jarod**, unsettling and poetic  
- **Alex**, the genius kid coding his way to freedom  

They’re not just NPCs — they’re threads. Meeting them again from new angles changes everything. Over time, you stop playing the game and start witnessing lives collide.

## 🎛️ Gameplay That Mirrors Mood

- Walk, bike, hitchhike, or steal your way forward  
- Choices shape both your own trip and the wider narrative  
- Sometimes it’s stealth. Sometimes it’s conversation. Sometimes it’s jukebox karaoke at a gas station

## 🎨 Underrated Artistry

- Stylized visuals that balance grit and warmth  
- Environments soaked in desert dusk and synthwave nostalgia  
- A soundtrack that’s *chef’s kiss* — ambient, emotional, road-trip perfection

## 📍 My Perspective

I haven’t even finished this game, and yet… I don’t feel behind. I feel like it’s waiting for me — a story told one ride at a time. Like *Firewatch*, it’s a game that whispers, not shouts.

**Rating:** 🌅🌅🌅🌅🛣️ / 5 roads worth taking
